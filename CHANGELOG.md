# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

<!-- Format: Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) -->

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `fnirs-log merge` + `utils/job_db.py`: SQLite DB from JSONL run logs
- `fnirs-gui` Data Preparation page (Analysis page stub)
- Boilerplate: paragraph-style Methods + HTML "Rendered" tab
- Hyper raw report supports `--session-label`
- `fnirs-qc group-raw` / `group-hyper-raw`: mriqc-style group reports (heatmap, boxplots, table, outlier panel)

### Changed
- **QC reports use BIDS-derivatives layout** (mriqc-style: per-subject / per-group subdirs with `figures/` and `[ses-XX/]nirs/`)
- Filenames standardized to `_nirs.*` suffix; main HTMLs use BIDS desc (`..._desc-raw_nirs.html`, `..._desc-hyperraw_nirs.html`)
- Hyper raw report now an iframe shell with auto-resize; Plotly loaded from CDN
- Shared helpers extracted: `qc/figure_io.py`, `qc/hyper_raw_writer.py`, `_base.css`, `_macros.html.j2`

### Fixed
- `HyperRatingApp` session-aware path for channel-decisions JSON
- `fnirs-qc` CLI initializes logging

### Known Issues
- Connectivity mode raises `NotImplementedError`
- `compute_alff` numerical validation pending (see TODO)

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- `fnirs-gui` CLI entry point launches a Dash multi-page application
- Data Preparation page: SNIRF file loader, editable stimulus marker table, per-subject IQM display
- Analysis page skeleton wired into the sidebar router

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Resting-state analysis mode added to the hyperscanning pipeline (`--mode rest`)
- ALFF and fALFF computation (`pipeline/restingstate.py`)
- Resting-state functional connectivity (Pearson correlation matrix across channels)
- Resting-state QC figures and report section
- `--trim` option for hyperscanning pipeline to discard leading/trailing seconds before analysis

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- ISC (inter-subject correlation) computation and heatmap visualization in hyperscanning post report
- WTC (wavelet transform coherence) computation and figure builders
- Connectogram visualization for hyperscanning functional connectivity (`qc/figures/connectogram.py`)
- Hyperscanning post-processing QC report (`qc/hyper_report.py`) with WTC, ISC, and connectogram sections
- Hyperscanning group-level raw QC report: Plotly figure builders for multi-dyad channel summaries
- Normalization option for hyperscanning raw data; `z_score` utility added

### Changed
- Hyperscanning functionality consolidated from a standalone CLI into `pipeline/hyperscanning.py`; `fnirs-hyper` CLI removed and subsumed under `fnirs-qc`

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `fnirs-qc` CLI (`cli/qc.py`) with `prep-raw` and hyperscanning subcommands
- Interactive raw QC viewer: standalone HTML page with Plotly channel traces (`qc/app.py`)
- IQM expansion: cardiac power band metrics and tSNR per channel (`qc/quantitative_metrics.py`)
- Channel quality summary figure integrated into prep-raw report and templates

### Changed
- SCI computation corrected; figure axis labels clarified across multiple panels

### Fixed
- Empty epoch subsets no longer crash `build_channel_figure`
- Unused imports and variables cleaned up across figure modules

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Task GLM postprocessing via nilearn (`pipeline/glm.py`): design matrix construction, contrast estimation
- Denoise mode: bandpass filter + optional resampling (`pipeline/denoise.py`)
- GLM QC section in per-subject report: design matrix timeseries figure + nilearn activation heatmap
- Raw residuals written as a separate SNIRF file after GLM fitting
- Motion correction figures improved: bad-segment zoom panel now runs independently of the motion carpet

### Fixed
- `_section_motion` bad-segment zoom was incorrectly nested inside the motion panel's `except` block; now executes unconditionally after the main panel

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Per-subject HTML QC report generated via Jinja2 + Plotly (`qc/prep_raw_report.py`)
- Report sections: OD traces, SCI/PSP heatmaps, GVTD timeseries, motion carpet, HbO/HbR correlation panel, PSD, brain views, short-channel PSD, IQM table
- IQM sidecar files: `sub-{id}_iqm.toml` + `sub-{id}_channel_metrics.csv`
- `_guard` context manager for uniform per-section error handling; failed sections render a warning card rather than crashing the report

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- End-to-end single-subject preprocessing: OD conversion, SCI/PSP channel QC, motion detection and correction (TDDR), Beer-Lambert law
- Pipeline reorganized into `pipeline/` module: `prep_pipeline.py`, `post_pipeline.py`, `glm.py`, `denoise.py`
- BIDS Derivatives sidecar writing; intermediate SNIRF written at each prep step
- `fnirs-pipe` CLI via Typer with all planned preprocessing flags wired
- `fnirs-recon` CLI for raw → BIDS conversion
- Run record and script utilities (`utils/run_record.py`, `utils/run_script.py`)
- Logging setup (`utils/logging.py`)
